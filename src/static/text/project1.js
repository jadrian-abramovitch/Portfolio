const project1String = 'Find Me A Team allows users to connect with other players from their favorite games. While you can view all of the posts created by other people without an account, creating an account is simple and allows you to make a post that other players can see. This site is able to facilitate these human connections without having all features 100% complete. Some features that will be implemented later include: player to player chat, profile pictures and a customized feed of players to look at based on your own posts. Currenly the only game supported is League of Legends, but will be expanded to other games such as CS:GO, Overwatch, Dota etc.';
